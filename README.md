MazeGame
========

A maze game written in Java

This is a maze game that I did with a few other guys for a project for uni. It was interesting to work in a group on 
something this ambitious, as none of us had ever done something of this scope in a group. The result was a very decent
maze game and a whole lot of learning. The not-very-though-out nature of our design reflects the naivety we had going
in to the project and some communication issues as we progressive.

I worked on the maze generation algorithm, some of the gui, a lot of debugging and some of the overall design (system 
interaction). I also wrote the shell scripts which run and compile the game. 

My other team members were Aaron Ramshaw, Aaron Carvalho and Rahul Aswani.
